# angular-full-stack-app
This app is built with Angular 4, Node.js, Express and MongoDB with Mongoose. It is deployed on Heroku with mLab on Amazon cloud.  
Users can signup and  post messages upon authentication. On load, the app will list all messages stored in MongoDB. 
But a currently logged in user is only allowed to edit and delete their own posted messages. 
In fact the ‘edit’ and ‘delete’ buttons are hidden from the other messages.
